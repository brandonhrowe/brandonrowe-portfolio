# Brandon Rowe Portfolio Page

This iteration of my site was built with the help of Gatsby - specifically the Strata site template, designed by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/strata). Check out https://codebushi.com/gatsby-starters-and-themes/ for more Gatsby starters and templates.

## Installation

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
`gatsby new gatsby-starter-strata https://github.com/ChangoMan/gatsby-starter-strata`

Run `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start.
